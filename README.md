# FirstSwift
Beginning of my Swift Project

My name is Sugbin Jung, who is computer engineering major at the University of Florida.
This is my first project on Swift and even first project using GitHub.
I am following an udemy course for this repo.

First Project: Cat Years
- very simple. Ask users about the age, then multiply by 7 to convert them to cat years.
  Then, display the cat years to the interface.
